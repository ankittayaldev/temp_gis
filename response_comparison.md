Main Answer

1) Summary of CSFs, SIs, and KPIs from the AMGEVITA brand plan

Table: CSFs with aligned Strategic Initiatives (SIs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| CSF | What it means | Core Strategic Initiatives (SIs) | Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) |
|---|---|---|---|
| CSF 1: Biosimilars Commitment | Commit enterprise resources, governance, and pace suitable for a biosimilar business | - Country-level business cases and forecasts; budget allocation - Establish nimble contracting/pricing governance and DAI - Align commercial incentives to biosimilar vision - Train internal teams on the “Amgen biosimilars story” - Prioritize launch sequences and resource biosimilars/inflammation at global, regional, country levels | - By Dec 2018: Country forecast complete - By Dec/Jan 2018: Resource assessment complete; budget allocated - By Apr 1, 2018: Contracting and pricing governance established |
| CSF 2: Inflammation Infrastructure and Relationships | Rapidly build TA infrastructure (rheumatology, GI prioritized) and external presence | - Hire marketing, VAP, medical, RMLs, field force - Transfer learnings from US/CA; champion rotations - Identify rheum/GI OLs and procurement committee members; schedule meetings | - By Jan 1, 2018: Marketing, VAP, Medical team hired - By Apr 1, 2018: RMLs hired; OLs and procurement members identified - By Jul 1, 2018: Field force hired; meetings with >80% OLs/procurement |
| CSF 3: Elevate Importance of Non-Economic Decision Factors | Increase weight of supply, data, product, services, manufacturer reputation in selection | - Monthly pre-launch engagement plan with decision-makers - Country-level payer communications (white papers) - Map decision journeys; segment accounts; HEOR tools (BIM, CMA, Account calculators) - Develop tender capability; define non-price criteria and weights | - By Apr 1, 2018: >80% of top priority accounts engaged - By Jul 1, 2018: 100% top priority + >50% second priority engaged - Quarterly: % of top accounts increasing weight of non-price criteria - By Launch: 100% priority accounts place country-defined X% weight on non-price criteria |
| CSF 4: Invest and Promote to Differentiate AMGEVITA | Build on strengths (supply, data, device) and invest in services and RWE to be #1 ADA | - Brand book, global launch campaign, localized assets - Country micro-sites; communication platform - Build patient/HCP services; hire hub/service teams - Collect, publish, and communicate early-country RWE - HCP “elevator pitch” focused on totality of evidence, supply, device, services, reputation - Develop starter kits; demo kits | - Quarterly (from Apr 2018): % top payers/committees who consider AMGEVITA #1 ADA at selection (price parity assumed) - Quarterly (from Apr 2018): % top prescribers who consider AMGEVITA #1 at prescription decision |
| CSF 5: Shape Tenders & Ensure Contracts at Launch | Engage pre-launch to shape criteria and secure contracts at launch (within legal/compliance) | - Map tender/contracting timelines and requirements - Pre-launch tender/contract framework discussions (as permitted) - Establish portfolio/innovative contracting strategy and governance - Global/region/country pricing policies; price in Tier 1–2 band (avoid race-to-bottom) | - By Launch: Leading share of contracts/tenders won among priority accounts versus ADA biosimilar competitors |
| CSF 6: Drive Rapid AMGEVITA Uptake | Establish pull-through engine and cross-functional coordination to convert access into Rx | - Build biosimilar Pull-Through Team; define account-specific pull-through - Prepare hub support; V&A contacts; sales force readiness - Develop tools (BIM, training), demo and starter kits - Coordinate targets and resources across functions | - Monthly: % of new ADA starts on AMGEVITA (vs. LRP) - Monthly: % of existing Humira patients placed on AMGEVITA (vs. LRP) - Sources: HCP survey, IMS |

Notes
- The plan consistently positions AMGEVITA’s differentiation around total value: totality of evidence + supply reliability + device + services + manufacturer reputation.
- Pricing guidance: net price within Tier 1–2 competitor band; differentiate on value rather than undercutting the lowest price.

2) Suggested optimal channels by persona (aligned to traits/preferences)

Table: Personas with traits and optimal channels

| Persona | Traits and preferences | Optimal channels | Content emphasis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Value Payer | Balances quality, cost, and uptake; values non-price factors (reputation, data, supply, services) | - Direct: Account manager and procurement committee meetings - Evidence assets: Value dossiers, white papers, HE models (BIM/CMA), RWE briefs - Digital: Secure micro-portal with clinical/data packs, case studies, RWE updates - Services: Pull-through program briefings | Total value story: supply reliability, robust data (H2H, safety, transition), device/formulation, service model; predictable budget savings through rapid uptake |
| Budget Payer | Cost minimization; price-centric processes (binary tenders, high control) | - Tools: Interactive cost–benefit calculators that quantify risks of lowest-price-only choice and value of reliability/services - Workshops: Educational sessions on multi-criteria evaluation and tender design - Negotiation: In-person/virtual contracting sessions framing multi-criteria scoring | Show that “lowest price ≠ greatest savings” when uptake/continuity risks are considered; highlight adoption enablers (supply, services) that de-risk savings |
| Risk-Averse (payer/HCP-influenced) | Preference for reference brand; safety/efficacy concerns; strong originator ties | - 1:1 engagements: Medical/account-led meetings to address clinical concerns - Scientific education: Transition data, long-term safety, analytical similarity overviews - Expert forums: Webinars/roundtables with KOLs; interactive Q&A - Co-engagement: Joint sessions with trusted physicians/pharmacists | Evidence precedes practice: emphasize totality of evidence, transition data in RA/PsO, post-launch RWE, and Amgen’s manufacturing pedigree |
| Global Market Expansion (strategic audience segment across regions) | Prioritizes regional scaling across rheum, derm, GI via partnerships | - Reports: Regional market insight briefs; success-story casebooks - Partnerships: Collaborations with local providers, societies, procurement bodies - Digital: Targeted campaigns (regional portals, paid media) | Regional proof points, partnership models, and scalability of services and supply reliability to enable rapid, compliant market entry |

Optional additional key decision-maker personas (to accelerate uptake aligned with CSFs 4 and 6)

| Persona | Traits and preferences | Optimal channels | Content emphasis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prescribing HCPs | Prioritize body of evidence; consider supply, device, services as tie-breakers | - MSL/medical education; congress symposia; peer-reviewed publications - Webinars/CMEs; concise evidence decks; in-clinic device demos - RWE digests; patient support program overviews | Comprehensive totality of evidence; virtually painless citrate-free formulation; SureClick device track record; services that support initiation/adherence |
| Pharmacists | Operational reliability; substitution rules; workflow practicality | - Pharmacy in-services; substitution policy briefings; supply service SLAs - Quick guides; product handling and device training; hotline access | Reliable supply chain; dispensing readiness; how-to on substitution/permission where required; coordination with prescribers |

Reasoning

- Extracted the six CSFs verbatim from the plan summary, then mapped each to the detailed execution activities and governance described across the “Execution Activities,” “How to Win,” and “Organization” pages to formulate succinct SIs per CSF.
- Compiled KPIs where explicitly listed per CSF (pages covering CSF 1, 3, 4, 6, and the consolidated KPI table including CSF 2 and 5) and aligned them to the corresponding CSF row.
- For channels by persona: used the provided NEXT Insight persona breakdowns (Value, Budget, Risk-Averse, and Global Market Expansion) and aligned channels to each persona’s stated traits. Where helpful for uptake (CSFs 4 and 6), added optional rows for Prescribing HCPs and Pharmacists, grounded in brand plan evidence on decision drivers and desired beliefs.
- Kept tables concise, using the brand plan’s value drivers and evidence hierarchy (e.g., “evidence precedes practice,” supply reliability) to prioritize channel types and content focus.

Rationale

- Framework: Strategy execution logic pairs each CSF with enabling SIs and measurable KPIs. This is consistent with the brand plan’s structure (“How to Win” CSFs, “Execution Activities,” “KPIs”).
- Evidence alignment: The channel recommendations mirror the plan’s documented decision drivers by stakeholder: payers (price first, but Value segment considers supply, services, data, device), HCPs (clinical/RWE highest, supply/device/services as tie-breakers), and pharmacists (substitution and operational readiness). This ensures channels deliver the information format each audience trusts and uses.
- Risk/benefit logic for Budget payers: The plan stresses that “lowest price ≠ greatest savings” if adoption fails; hence tools and workshops that quantify uptake risk and value-based tendering are prioritized.
- Differentiation emphasis: For Value payers and HCPs, channels that foreground totality of evidence, supply reliability, device/formulation, and services match CSF 3 and 4, and support CSF 5 (tender shaping) and CSF 6 (pull-through).
- Limitations: The source materials provide historical KPI timelines (2017–2018) and not current-year targets; we report them faithfully and treat them as templates. Market-by-country nuances in tender legality and substitution are acknowledged but not detailed here; channels should be localized accordingly.

CSF 2, 4, 6) | Share RWE and success stories; readiness reviews; harmonize best practices | RWE publications; replicated service models; cross-country adoption |\n\nTable 3. Optimal communication channels by persona (traits-aligned)\n\n| Persona | Traits and preferences | Optimal channels |\n|---|---|---|\n| Value Payer (Value accounts; procurement committees) | Balance cost, quality, uptake; consider non-price factors (supply, services, data, device, partnership, RWE) | Direct: KAM/procurement committee meetings; pre-tender work sessions; payer advisory boards. Digital: dedicated payer portal/micro-site; webinars; interactive HE models (BIM, CMA, account calculators); tender-criteria templates. Content: value dossier, white papers, RWE case studies; portfolio/innovative contracting proposals. Services: pull-through support menus; SLAs; TDM support. |\n| Budget Payer (price-driven) | Cost minimization; binary tenders; price-blind contracting; high control | Direct: contracting/tender Q&A; in-person or virtual negotiations; succinct decision briefs. Digital: cost-savings calculators; scenario analyses; one-page parity comparisons. Content: supply reliability assurances; service ROI that protects budgets; risk mitigation checklists; sustainability messaging. |\n| Risk-Averse Payer (initially branded preference) | Concerned about safety/efficacy; low control vs HCPs; convert later; value expert reassurance | Direct: one-on-one MSL/medical meetings; small expert roundtables; KOL co-engagement. Digital: live webinars with interactive Q&A; micro-learning modules on safety/transition evidence; curated evidence libraries. Content: transition data (RA, PsO), long-term safety, pharmacovigilance, manufacturer track record; device training and patient support overviews. |\n| Prescribing HCP (biosimilar uptake decision-maker) | Values body of evidence (clinical + RWE) above all; also considers supply, device, services; wants assurance | Medical: MSL scientific exchange; congress symposia; grand rounds; CPD-accredited webinars; peer-to-peer programs. Digital: eDetailing; on-demand modules; evidence dashboards; device demo videos. Content: head-to-head RA/PsO, 2-year safety, single-switch data, 855 subject-years; citrate-free and SureClick device; service access guides. Services: patient starter kits; nurse educator access; reimbursement/hub support. |\n| Dispensing Pharmacist (biosimilar uptake facilitator) | Operates within substitution rules; needs clear formulary status, supply/logistics, handling, counseling tools | Digital: formulary bulletins; e-procurement listings; EHR/e-prescribing prompts; pharmacy e-newsletters; short e-learning modules. Direct: in-pharmacy in-services; distributor trainings; hotline for supply queries. Content: substitution checklists; device handling and counseling aids; inventory & ordering guidance; pharmacovigilance reporting tips. |\n\nNotes:\n- Channels above align with the brand plan\u2019s segmentation: biosimilar selection decision-makers (payers/procurement) and biosimilar uptake decision-makers (prescribers/pharmacists).\n- The table builds on the partially provided persona-channel guidance (Value, Budget, Risk-Averse payers), expanded to include HCP and pharmacist personas explicitly called out as uptake decision-makers.\n\nActionable next steps\n- Stand up a persona-by-segment engagement calendar: monthly touchpoints for value/budget/risk-averse accounts; quarterly HCP/pharmacist educational cycles tied to congresses and local society events.\n- Operationalize the payer portal and HE tools for pre-tender cycles; track tender-criteria shifts as leading indicators for CSF 3 and CSF 5.\n- Instrument channel KPIs: webinar attendance/completion; HE tool usage; dossier downloads; MSL visit reach; service enrollment; pharmacy e-learning completion\u2014then correlate with tender wins and uptake curves.\n\nReasoning\n- Identified and enumerated all six CSFs and their KPIs from the brand plan pages and the consolidated KPIs summary. Cross-checked each CSF\u2019s KPI timing and measures across detailed CSF pages (1, 3, 4, 5, 6) and the page summarizing all KPIs.\n- Extracted and normalized SIs from execution tables (cross-functional, VAP, commercial/marketing), tender/pricing guidance, and persona/account strategy slides. Mapped each SI to the CSF(s) it advances, keeping activities and deliverables concise and aligned to the cited artifacts.\n- Built persona-channel mapping from: (a) the plan\u2019s segmentation of decision-makers (payers/procurement vs. HCPs/pharmacists), (b) the value drivers per segment (e.g., data first for HCPs; non-price weighting for value payers), and (c) the partially visible NEXT Insight persona-channel table. Expanded to include HCP and pharmacist personas explicitly identified as uptake decision-makers in the plan.\n- Prioritized clarity and brevity in tables, ensuring each recommendation is traceable to the plan\u2019s stated strengths (evidence, supply, device, services), tender-shaping needs, and pull-through design.\n\nRationale\n- The CSF/KPI table directly mirrors the brand plan\u2019s structure: six CSFs spanning foundation, differentiation, contracts, and uptake, each with explicit KPIs and dates. This ensures fidelity to the source and clarity in execution tracking.\n- SIs are organized to reflect an end-to-end commercialization path in biosimilars (pre-launch resourcing \u2192 stakeholder education \u2192 tender shaping \u2192 differentiation \u2192 pull-through). This aligns with the brand plan\u2019s biosimilars-specific success requirements (speed, nimble governance, differentiation, segmentation/targeting).\n- Persona-channel recommendations follow the principle of message-channel fit: decision-makers weighting non-price factors (Value payers) benefit from deeper evidence, tools, and services presented through advisory/formal engagements and portals; price-focused (Budget) audiences need concise, ROI-centric contracting interactions; Risk-averse payers require medical/KOL-led reassurance. HCPs value clinical/RWE above all (thus medical/scientific channels), while pharmacists need operational clarity (formulary/e-procurement, substitution guidance).\n- Limitations/uncertainties: The persona section provided in the context was partially truncated (Risk-Averse persona row incomplete).

Optimal communication channels by persona (traits-aligned)\n\n| Persona | Traits and preferences | Optimal channels |\n|---|---|---|\n| Value Payer (Value accounts; procurement committees) | Balance cost, quality, uptake; consider non-price factors (supply, services, data, device, partnership, RWE) | Direct: KAM/procurement committee meetings; pre-tender work sessions; payer advisory boards. Digital: dedicated payer portal/micro-site; webinars; interactive HE models (BIM, CMA, account calculators); tender-criteria templates. Content: value dossier, white papers, RWE case studies; portfolio/innovative contracting proposals. Services: pull-through support menus; SLAs; TDM support. |\n| Budget Payer (price-driven) | Cost minimization; binary tenders; price-blind contracting; high control | Direct: contracting/tender Q&A; in-person or virtual negotiations; succinct decision briefs. Digital: cost-savings calculators; scenario analyses; one-page parity comparisons. Content: supply reliability assurances; service ROI that protects budgets; risk mitigation checklists; sustainability messaging. |\n| Risk-Averse Payer (initially branded preference) | Concerned about safety/efficacy; low control vs HCPs; convert later; value expert reassurance | Direct: one-on-one MSL/medical meetings; small expert roundtables; KOL co-engagement. Digital: live webinars with interactive Q&A; micro-learning modules on safety/transition evidence; curated evidence libraries. Content: transition data (RA, PsO), long-term safety, pharmacovigilance, manufacturer track record; device training and patient support overviews. |\n| Prescribing HCP (biosimilar uptake decision-maker) | Values body of evidence (clinical + RWE) above all; also considers supply, device, services; wants assurance | Medical: MSL scientific exchange; congress symposia; grand rounds; CPD-accredited webinars; peer-to-peer programs. Digital: eDetailing; on-demand modules; evidence dashboards; device demo videos. Content: head-to-head RA/PsO, 2-year safety, single-switch data, 855 subject-years; citrate-free and SureClick device; service access guides. Services: patient starter kits; nurse educator access; reimbursement/hub support. |\n| Dispensing Pharmacist (biosimilar uptake facilitator) | Operates within substitution rules; needs clear formulary status, supply/logistics, handling, counseling tools | Digital: formulary bulletins; e-procurement listings; EHR/e-prescribing prompts; pharmacy e-newsletters; short e-learning modules. Direct: in-pharmacy in-services; distributor trainings; hotline for supply queries. Content: substitution checklists; device handling and counseling aids; inventory & ordering guidance; pharmacovigilance reporting tips. |\n\nNotes:\n- Channels above align with the brand plan’s segmentation: biosimilar selection decision-makers (payers/procurement) and biosimilar uptake decision-makers (prescribers/pharmacists).\n- The table builds on the partially provided persona-channel guidance (Value, Budget, Risk-Averse payers), expanded to include HCP and pharmacist personas explicitly called out as uptake decision-makers.\n\nActionable next steps\n- Stand up a persona-by-segment engagement calendar: monthly touchpoints for value/budget/risk-averse accounts; quarterly HCP/pharmacist educational cycles tied to congresses and local society events.\n- Operationalize the payer portal and HE tools for pre-tender cycles; track tender-criteria shifts as leading indicators for CSF 3 and CSF 5.\n- Instrument channel KPIs: webinar attendance/completion; HE tool usage; dossier downloads; MSL visit reach; service enrollment; pharmacy e-learning completion—then correlate with tender wins and uptake curves.\n\nReasoning\n- Identified and enumerated all six CSFs and their KPIs from the brand plan pages and the consolidated KPIs summary. Cross-checked each CSF’s KPI timing and measures across detailed CSF pages (1, 3, 4, 5, 6) and the page summarizing all KPIs.\n- Extracted and normalized SIs from execution tables (cross-functional, VAP, commercial/marketing), tender/pricing guidance, and persona/account strategy slides. Mapped each SI to the CSF(s) it advances, keeping activities and deliverables concise and aligned to the cited artifacts.\n- Built persona-channel mapping from: (a) the plan’s segmentation of decision-makers (payers/procurement vs. HCPs/pharmacists), (b) the value drivers per segment (e.g., data first for HCPs; non-price weighting for value payers), and (c) the partially visible NEXT Insight persona-channel table. Expanded to include HCP and pharmacist personas explicitly identified as uptake decision-makers in the plan.\n- Prioritized clarity and brevity in tables, ensuring each recommendation is traceable to the plan’s stated strengths (evidence, supply, device, services), tender-shaping needs, and pull-through design.\n\nRationale\n- The CSF/KPI table directly mirrors the brand plan’s structure: six CSFs spanning foundation, differentiation, contracts, and uptake, each with explicit KPIs and dates. This ensures fidelity to the source and clarity in execution tracking.\n- SIs are organized to reflect an end-to-end commercialization path in biosimilars (pre-launch resourcing → stakeholder education → tender shaping → differentiation → pull-through). This aligns with the brand plan’s biosimilars-specific success requirements (speed, nimble governance, differentiation, segmentation/targeting).\n- Persona-channel recommendations follow the principle of message-channel fit: decision-makers weighting non-price factors (Value payers) benefit from deeper evidence, tools, and services presented through advisory/formal engagements and portals; price-focused (Budget) audiences need concise, ROI-centric contracting interactions; Risk-averse payers require medical/KOL-led reassurance. HCPs value clinical/RWE above all (thus medical/scientific channels), while pharmacists need operational clarity (formulary/e-procurement, substitution guidance).\n- Limitations/uncertainties: The persona section provided in the context was partially truncated (Risk-Averse persona row incomplete). To mitigate this, channel suggestions for risk-averse payers were derived from plan content emphasizing safety/efficacy, transition data, and expert opinions. Timelines reflect 2018 launch planning; the strategic logic and measurement framework remain applicable, but market conditions and regulations may have evolved—local adaptation is recommended.\n\nReferences\n- CSFs overview and imperatives: “We must have laser focus on 6 CSFs…” (Page 57).\n- KPI summary across CSFs: “Key Performance Indicators Summary” (Page 82).\n- CSF 1 details and KPIs: “Company-wide commitment…” (Page 58).\n- CSF 2 hiring/engagement milestones: Execution Activities (Pages 83, 85); CSF 2 KPIs summarized (Page 82).\n- CSF 3 desired state, criteria, and KPIs: “CSF 3: Elevate importance of non-economic decision factors” (CSF page with desired state and KPIs); KPI summary (Page 82).\n- CSF 4 desired state and KPIs: “Invest and Promote to Differentiate AMGEVITA” (Page 70); KPI summary (Page 82).

Value is most receptive to Amgen | • Identify & archetype accounts, map decision-makers <br> • Prioritize and engage value accounts |\n| **BioS Selection** |  |\n| • Price is #1 determinant of biosimilar selection <br> • Value payers will include other criteria | • Elevate the importance of non-economic tender/ contract criteria |\n| |  |\n| • Sandoz, Pfizer, and Biogen/MSD have an advantage over Amgen in terms of (Ex-US/CA) inflammation presence, biosimilars experience, and portfolio <br> • However, Amgen has strengths in supply reliability, clinical data, and product attributes | • Educate key decision makers on strengths in supply reliability, clinical data, and product attributes <br> • Invest in further differentiation via best-in-class services, RWE, portfolio/innovative contracting <br> • Price competitively |\n| **BioS Uptake** |  |\n| • Stakeholders target BioS for new starts, do not expect to switch stable PTs in initial years (except select mkts) <br> • Prescribers value data above all else; and will also consider device, supply & services | • Prioritize new patient starts for proactive uptake <br> • Excellence in body of evidence (clinical data, RWE), supply, device, & services can support rapid uptake. |\n| **BioS Retention** |  |\n| • At contract renewals, late-entrants can displace incumbents via discounts; several late entrants are Tier 2/3 and will place downward price pressure <br> • Majority of HCPs & Phams expect to feel comfortable switching between biosimilars | • Be first in the market to have a critical mass of contracts with pre-launch engagement and education <br> • Earn following years’ contract with this year's performance; and build retention with services, RWE <br> • Need a nimble organization to enable rapid decisions |\n\n---\n\n*Page 40*\n\n*Amgen Confidential – Do Not Distribute*\n```\n[No images to describe on this page.]\n",

Main Answer

1) Summary of CSFs, SIs, and KPIs from the AMGEVITA brand plan

Table: CSFs with aligned Strategic Initiatives (SIs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| CSF | What it means | Core Strategic Initiatives (SIs) | Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) |
|---|---|---|---|
| CSF 1: Biosimilars Commitment | Commit enterprise resources, governance, and pace suitable for a biosimilar business | - Country-level business cases and forecasts; budget allocation - Establish nimble contracting/pricing governance and DAI - Align commercial incentives to biosimilar vision - Train internal teams on the “Amgen biosimilars story” - Prioritize launch sequences and resource biosimilars/inflammation at global, regional, country levels | - By Dec 2018: Country forecast complete - By Dec/Jan 2018: Resource assessment complete; budget allocated - By Apr 1, 2018: Contracting and pricing governance established |
| CSF 2: Inflammation Infrastructure and Relationships | Rapidly build TA infrastructure (rheumatology, GI prioritized) and external presence | - Hire marketing, VAP, medical, RMLs, field force - Transfer learnings from US/CA; champion rotations - Identify rheum/GI OLs and procurement committee members; schedule meetings | - By Jan 1, 2018: Marketing, VAP, Medical team hired - By Apr 1, 2018: RMLs hired; OLs and procurement members identified - By Jul 1, 2018: Field force hired; meetings with >80% OLs/procurement |
| CSF 3: Elevate Importance of Non-Economic Decision Factors | Increase weight of supply, data, product, services, manufacturer reputation in selection | - Monthly pre-launch engagement plan with decision-makers - Country-level payer communications (white papers) - Map decision journeys; segment accounts; HEOR tools (BIM, CMA, Account calculators) - Develop tender capability; define non-price criteria and weights | - By Apr 1, 2018: >80% of top priority accounts engaged - By Jul 1, 2018: 100% top priority + >50% second priority engaged - Quarterly: % of top accounts increasing weight of non-price criteria - By Launch: 100% priority accounts place country-defined X% weight on non-price criteria |
| CSF 4: Invest and Promote to Differentiate AMGEVITA | Build on strengths (supply, data, device) and invest in services and RWE to be #1 ADA | - Brand book, global launch campaign, localized assets - Country micro-sites; communication platform - Build patient/HCP services; hire hub/service teams - Collect, publish, and communicate early-country RWE - HCP “elevator pitch” focused on totality of evidence, supply, device, services, reputation - Develop starter kits; demo kits | - Quarterly (from Apr 2018): % top payers/committees who consider AMGEVITA #1 ADA at selection (price parity assumed) - Quarterly (from Apr 2018): % top prescribers who consider AMGEVITA #1 at prescription decision |
| CSF 5: Shape Tenders & Ensure Contracts at Launch | Engage pre-launch to shape criteria and secure contracts at launch (within legal/compliance) | - Map tender/contracting timelines and requirements - Pre-launch tender/contract framework discussions (as permitted) - Establish portfolio/innovative contracting strategy and governance - Global/region/country pricing policies; price in Tier 1–2 band (avoid race-to-bottom) | - By Launch: Leading share of contracts/tenders won among priority accounts versus ADA biosimilar competitors |
| CSF 6: Drive Rapid AMGEVITA Uptake | Establish pull-through engine and cross-functional coordination to convert access into Rx | - Build biosimilar Pull-Through Team; define account-specific pull-through - Prepare hub support; V&A contacts; sales force readiness - Develop tools (BIM, training), demo and starter kits - Coordinate targets and resources across functions | - Monthly: % of new ADA starts on AMGEVITA (vs. LRP) - Monthly: % of existing Humira patients placed on AMGEVITA (vs. LRP) - Sources: HCP survey, IMS |

Notes
- The plan consistently positions AMGEVITA’s differentiation around total value: totality of evidence + supply reliability + device + services + manufacturer reputation.
- Pricing guidance: net price within Tier 1–2 competitor band; differentiate on value rather than undercutting the lowest price.

2) Suggested optimal channels by persona (aligned to traits/preferences)

Table: Personas with traits and optimal channels

| Persona | Traits and preferences | Optimal channels | Content emphasis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Value Payer | Balances quality, cost, and uptake; values non-price factors (reputation, data, supply, services) | - Direct: Account manager and procurement committee meetings - Evidence assets: Value dossiers, white papers, HE models (BIM/CMA), RWE briefs - Digital: Secure micro-portal with clinical/data packs, case studies, RWE updates - Services: Pull-through program briefings | Total value story: supply reliability, robust data (H2H, safety, transition), device/formulation, service model; predictable budget savings through rapid uptake |
| Budget Payer | Cost minimization; price-centric processes (binary tenders, high control) | - Tools: Interactive cost–benefit calculators that quantify risks of lowest-price-only choice and value of reliability/services - Workshops: Educational sessions on multi-criteria evaluation and tender design - Negotiation: In-person/virtual contracting sessions framing multi-criteria scoring | Show that “lowest price ≠ greatest savings” when uptake/continuity risks are considered; highlight adoption enablers (supply, services) that de-risk savings |
| Risk-Averse (payer/HCP-influenced) | Preference for reference brand; safety/efficacy concerns; strong originator ties | - 1:1 engagements: Medical/account-led meetings to address clinical concerns - Scientific education: Transition data, long-term safety, analytical similarity overviews - Expert forums: Webinars/roundtables with KOLs; interactive Q&A - Co-engagement: Joint sessions with trusted physicians/pharmacists | Evidence precedes practice: emphasize totality of evidence, transition data in RA/PsO, post-launch RWE, and Amgen’s manufacturing pedigree |
| Global Market Expansion (strategic audience segment across regions) | Prioritizes regional scaling across rheum, derm, GI via partnerships | - Reports: Regional market insight briefs; success-story casebooks - Partnerships: Collaborations with local providers, societies, procurement bodies - Digital: Targeted campaigns (regional portals, paid media) | Regional proof points, partnership models, and scalability of services and supply reliability to enable rapid, compliant market entry |

Optional additional key decision-maker personas (to accelerate uptake aligned with CSFs 4 and 6)

| Persona | Traits and preferences | Optimal channels | Content emphasis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prescribing HCPs | Prioritize body of evidence; consider supply, device, services as tie-breakers | - MSL/medical education; congress symposia; peer-reviewed publications - Webinars/CMEs; concise evidence decks; in-clinic device demos - RWE digests; patient support program overviews | Comprehensive totality of evidence; virtually painless citrate-free formulation; SureClick device track record; services that support initiation/adherence |
| Pharmacists | Operational reliability; substitution rules; workflow practicality | - Pharmacy in-services; substitution policy briefings; supply service SLAs - Quick guides; product handling and device training; hotline access | Reliable supply chain; dispensing readiness; how-to on substitution/permission where required; coordination with prescribers |

Reasoning

- Extracted the six CSFs verbatim from the plan summary, then mapped each to the detailed execution activities and governance described across the “Execution Activities,” “How to Win,” and “Organization” pages to formulate succinct SIs per CSF.
- Compiled KPIs where explicitly listed per CSF (pages covering CSF 1, 3, 4, 6, and the consolidated KPI table including CSF 2 and 5) and aligned them to the corresponding CSF row.
- For channels by persona: used the provided NEXT Insight persona breakdowns (Value, Budget, Risk-Averse, and Global Market Expansion) and aligned channels to each persona’s stated traits. Where helpful for uptake (CSFs 4 and 6), added optional rows for Prescribing HCPs and Pharmacists, grounded in brand plan evidence on decision drivers and desired beliefs.
- Kept tables concise, using the brand plan’s value drivers and evidence hierarchy (e.g., “evidence precedes practice,” supply reliability) to prioritize channel types and content focus.

Rationale

- Framework: Strategy execution logic pairs each CSF with enabling SIs and measurable KPIs. This is consistent with the brand plan’s structure (“How to Win” CSFs, “Execution Activities,” “KPIs”).
- Evidence alignment: The channel recommendations mirror the plan’s documented decision drivers by stakeholder: payers (price first, but Value segment considers supply, services, data, device), HCPs (clinical/RWE highest, supply/device/services as tie-breakers), and pharmacists (substitution and operational readiness). This ensures channels deliver the information format each audience trusts and uses.
- Risk/benefit logic for Budget payers: The plan stresses that “lowest price ≠ greatest savings” if adoption fails; hence tools and workshops that quantify uptake risk and value-based tendering are prioritized.
- Differentiation emphasis: For Value payers and HCPs, channels that foreground totality of evidence, supply reliability, device/formulation, and services match CSF 3 and 4, and support CSF 5 (tender shaping) and CSF 6 (pull-through).
- Limitations: The source materials provide historical KPI timelines (2017–2018) and not current-year targets; we report them faithfully and treat them as templates. Market-by-country nuances in tender legality and substitution are acknowledged but not detailed here; channels should be localized accordingly.

equip AMs with value dossiers, HE models, and RWE.\n- For Budget accounts, lead with HE tools and implementation support that connect price to realized savings via rapid uptake and retention.\n- For Risk-Averse accounts, sequence KOL-led safety/transition evidence and pilot programs to move them toward Value criteria weighting by the time of selection/tender.\n- Stand up dedicated portals/micro-sites for payers and HCPs to centralize evidence, services, and procurement documentation; measure quarterly via CSF 4 KPIs.\n- Ensure pull-through team readiness and pharmacy operations training by launch to capture new starts and drive early share (CSF 6).\n\nReasoning\n- Identified the six CSFs explicitly listed in the brand plan (launch foundation, differentiation, tender readiness, uptake) and pulled the official KPIs from the consolidated KPI list (p.82) and the individual CSF slides (e.g., CSF 4 p.70; CSF 6 p.77; CSF 5 p.74; CSF 3 slide). \n- Mapped SIs from the Execution Activities tables (BBU/Cross-Functional and Value Access & Policy; Commercial: Marketing/Pull-through) and from each CSF\u2019s \u201cDesired State/What Good Looks Like\u201d sections, consolidating overlapping activities (e.g., hiring, tender capability, RWE generation, service build-out) into representative SIs per CSF.\n- For personas and channels, combined: (a) the payer segmentation framework (Value, Budget, Risk-Averse) and their decision weights; (b) HCP value drivers (data first; device/supply/services as tie-breakers); (c) EU engagement channel norms for payers/HCPs from the NEXT insight; and (d) AMGEVITA\u2019s deliverables (brand book, micro-sites, starter kits, patient services) to ensure channel\u2013asset fit. \n- Structured both tables to ensure traceability from strategy (CSFs) \u2192 execution (SIs) \u2192 measurement (KPIs), and from traits \u2192 channels \u2192 assets/messages for each persona.\n\nRationale\n- The CSF\u2013SI\u2013KPI triangulation follows standard launch excellence and brand planning logic: define critical outcomes (CSFs), the enabling programs (SIs), and the success metrics (KPIs). The selections here are directly supported by the plan\u2019s CSF slides and execution activity tables. \n- Persona channel recommendations are grounded in the payer segmentation and value-driver evidence in the plan: Value payers consider non-price elements, necessitating content-rich direct engagement (value dossiers, HE models, RWE); Budget payers need price/HE clarity and implementation support; Risk-Averse payers respond to assurance via clinical rigor and KOL endorsements. For HCPs, evidence-first channels (publications, MSL exchange) align with the documented drivers; for pharmacists and patients, operational readiness and support services map to CSF 6 and the services build-out under CSF 4.\n- Limitations/uncertainty: Some context excerpts are partial (e.g., persona table truncation), and several timelines reflect 2017\u20132018 planning assumptions. Country-specific legal and tender rules vary; channel deployment should be adapted locally. Where explicit persona-channel details were incomplete, we relied on the plan\u2019s stated value drivers and execution assets to propose consistent, evidence-aligned channels.\n\nReferences\n- AMGEVITA Global Brand Plan: Six CSFs overview and narrative (Page 57).\n- KPIs by CSF consolidated table (Page 82).\n- CSF 1: Biosimilars Commitment (Page 58); Execution BBU/Cross-Functional (Page 83).\n- CSF 2: Inflammation Infrastructure & Relationships \u2013 hiring/engagement KPIs (Page 82); Execution BBU/Cross-Functional (Page 83).\n- CSF 3: Elevate Non-Economic Decision Factors \u2013 desired state and KPIs (CSF 3 slide); Value Access & Policy execution (Page 85); Payer value drivers and weighting (How To Win: CSF 3 slide).\n- CSF 4: Invest and Promote to Differentiate \u2013 KPIs (Page 70); HCP value drivers (Page 54); Benefit Ladder (Page 68); Key Story Flow/Elevator Pitch (Page 69); Brand positioning (Page 67).\n- CSF 5: Shape Tenders & Ensure Contracts \u2013 desired state and KPI (Page 74); Pricing strategy band (Page 73); AMGEVITA Value Story (Page 72); Segmentation/priority accounts (Page 71).\n- CSF 6: Drive Rapid Uptake \u2013 desired state and KPIs (Page 77); Execution Marketing: Pull-through team activities (Execution table).\n- Payer Segmentation and proportions (Pages 24, 52, 71).\n- Source of Business and communication guardrails (Pages 54\u201355).\n- Global deliverables and execution activities (Commercial/Marketing; Value Access & Policy).\n- NEXT Insight Report excerpts: Persona\u2013channel guidance (Value Payer, Budget, Risk-Averse) and preferred EU channels for payers/HCPs; Tabular summaries included in context (no page numbers provided).

Main Answer

1) Summary of CSFs, SIs, and KPIs from the AMGEVITA brand plan

Table: CSFs with aligned Strategic Initiatives (SIs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| CSF | What it means | Core Strategic Initiatives (SIs) | Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) |
|---|---|---|---|
| CSF 1: Biosimilars Commitment | Commit enterprise resources, governance, and pace suitable for a biosimilar business | - Country-level business cases and forecasts; budget allocation - Establish nimble contracting/pricing governance and DAI - Align commercial incentives to biosimilar vision - Train internal teams on the “Amgen biosimilars story” - Prioritize launch sequences and resource biosimilars/inflammation at global, regional, country levels | - By Dec 2018: Country forecast complete - By Dec/Jan 2018: Resource assessment complete; budget allocated - By Apr 1, 2018: Contracting and pricing governance established |
| CSF 2: Inflammation Infrastructure and Relationships | Rapidly build TA infrastructure (rheumatology, GI prioritized) and external presence | - Hire marketing, VAP, medical, RMLs, field force - Transfer learnings from US/CA; champion rotations - Identify rheum/GI OLs and procurement committee members; schedule meetings | - By Jan 1, 2018: Marketing, VAP, Medical team hired - By Apr 1, 2018: RMLs hired; OLs and procurement members identified - By Jul 1, 2018: Field force hired; meetings with >80% OLs/procurement |
| CSF 3: Elevate Importance of Non-Economic Decision Factors | Increase weight of supply, data, product, services, manufacturer reputation in selection | - Monthly pre-launch engagement plan with decision-makers - Country-level payer communications (white papers) - Map decision journeys; segment accounts; HEOR tools (BIM, CMA, Account calculators) - Develop tender capability; define non-price criteria and weights | - By Apr 1, 2018: >80% of top priority accounts engaged - By Jul 1, 2018: 100% top priority + >50% second priority engaged - Quarterly: % of top accounts increasing weight of non-price criteria - By Launch: 100% priority accounts place country-defined X% weight on non-price criteria |
| CSF 4: Invest and Promote to Differentiate AMGEVITA | Build on strengths (supply, data, device) and invest in services and RWE to be #1 ADA | - Brand book, global launch campaign, localized assets - Country micro-sites; communication platform - Build patient/HCP services; hire hub/service teams - Collect, publish, and communicate early-country RWE - HCP “elevator pitch” focused on totality of evidence, supply, device, services, reputation - Develop starter kits; demo kits | - Quarterly (from Apr 2018): % top payers/committees who consider AMGEVITA #1 ADA at selection (price parity assumed) - Quarterly (from Apr 2018): % top prescribers who consider AMGEVITA #1 at prescription decision |
| CSF 5: Shape Tenders & Ensure Contracts at Launch | Engage pre-launch to shape criteria and secure contracts at launch (within legal/compliance) | - Map tender/contracting timelines and requirements - Pre-launch tender/contract framework discussions (as permitted) - Establish portfolio/innovative contracting strategy and governance - Global/region/country pricing policies; price in Tier 1–2 band (avoid race-to-bottom) | - By Launch: Leading share of contracts/tenders won among priority accounts versus ADA biosimilar competitors |
| CSF 6: Drive Rapid AMGEVITA Uptake | Establish pull-through engine and cross-functional coordination to convert access into Rx | - Build biosimilar Pull-Through Team; define account-specific pull-through - Prepare hub support; V&A contacts; sales force readiness - Develop tools (BIM, training), demo and starter kits - Coordinate targets and resources across functions | - Monthly: % of new ADA starts on AMGEVITA (vs. LRP) - Monthly: % of existing Humira patients placed on AMGEVITA (vs. LRP) - Sources: HCP survey, IMS |

Notes
- The plan consistently positions AMGEVITA’s differentiation around total value: totality of evidence + supply reliability + device + services + manufacturer reputation.
- Pricing guidance: net price within Tier 1–2 competitor band; differentiate on value rather than undercutting the lowest price.

2) Suggested optimal channels by persona (aligned to traits/preferences)

Table: Personas with traits and optimal channels

| Persona | Traits and preferences | Optimal channels | Content emphasis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Value Payer | Balances quality, cost, and uptake; values non-price factors (reputation, data, supply, services) | - Direct: Account manager and procurement committee meetings - Evidence assets: Value dossiers, white papers, HE models (BIM/CMA), RWE briefs - Digital: Secure micro-portal with clinical/data packs, case studies, RWE updates - Services: Pull-through program briefings | Total value story: supply reliability, robust data (H2H, safety, transition), device/formulation, service model; predictable budget savings through rapid uptake |
| Budget Payer | Cost minimization; price-centric processes (binary tenders, high control) | - Tools: Interactive cost–benefit calculators that quantify risks of lowest-price-only choice and value of reliability/services - Workshops: Educational sessions on multi-criteria evaluation and tender design - Negotiation: In-person/virtual contracting sessions framing multi-criteria scoring | Show that “lowest price ≠ greatest savings” when uptake/continuity risks are considered; highlight adoption enablers (supply, services) that de-risk savings |
| Risk-Averse (payer/HCP-influenced) | Preference for reference brand; safety/efficacy concerns; strong originator ties | - 1:1 engagements: Medical/account-led meetings to address clinical concerns - Scientific education: Transition data, long-term safety, analytical similarity overviews - Expert forums: Webinars/roundtables with KOLs; interactive Q&A - Co-engagement: Joint sessions with trusted physicians/pharmacists | Evidence precedes practice: emphasize totality of evidence, transition data in RA/PsO, post-launch RWE, and Amgen’s manufacturing pedigree |
| Global Market Expansion (strategic audience segment across regions) | Prioritizes regional scaling across rheum, derm, GI via partnerships | - Reports: Regional market insight briefs; success-story casebooks - Partnerships: Collaborations with local providers, societies, procurement bodies - Digital: Targeted campaigns (regional portals, paid media) | Regional proof points, partnership models, and scalability of services and supply reliability to enable rapid, compliant market entry |

Optional additional key decision-maker personas (to accelerate uptake aligned with CSFs 4 and 6)

| Persona | Traits and preferences | Optimal channels | Content emphasis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prescribing HCPs | Prioritize body of evidence; consider supply, device, services as tie-breakers | - MSL/medical education; congress symposia; peer-reviewed publications - Webinars/CMEs; concise evidence decks; in-clinic device demos - RWE digests; patient support program overviews | Comprehensive totality of evidence; virtually painless citrate-free formulation; SureClick device track record; services that support initiation/adherence |
| Pharmacists | Operational reliability; substitution rules; workflow practicality | - Pharmacy in-services; substitution policy briefings; supply service SLAs - Quick guides; product handling and device training; hotline access | Reliable supply chain; dispensing readiness; how-to on substitution/permission where required; coordination with prescribers |

Reasoning

- Extracted the six CSFs verbatim from the plan summary, then mapped each to the detailed execution activities and governance described across the “Execution Activities,” “How to Win,” and “Organization” pages to formulate succinct SIs per CSF.
- Compiled KPIs where explicitly listed per CSF (pages covering CSF 1, 3, 4, 6, and the consolidated KPI table including CSF 2 and 5) and aligned them to the corresponding CSF row.
- For channels by persona: used the provided NEXT Insight persona breakdowns (Value, Budget, Risk-Averse, and Global Market Expansion) and aligned channels to each persona’s stated traits. Where helpful for uptake (CSFs 4 and 6), added optional rows for Prescribing HCPs and Pharmacists, grounded in brand plan evidence on decision drivers and desired beliefs.
- Kept tables concise, using the brand plan’s value drivers and evidence hierarchy (e.g., “evidence precedes practice,” supply reliability) to prioritize channel types and content focus.

Rationale

- Framework: Strategy execution logic pairs each CSF with enabling SIs and measurable KPIs. This is consistent with the brand plan’s structure (“How to Win” CSFs, “Execution Activities,” “KPIs”).
- Evidence alignment: The channel recommendations mirror the plan’s documented decision drivers by stakeholder: payers (price first, but Value segment considers supply, services, data, device), HCPs (clinical/RWE highest, supply/device/services as tie-breakers), and pharmacists (substitution and operational readiness). This ensures channels deliver the information format each audience trusts and uses.
- Risk/benefit logic for Budget payers: The plan stresses that “lowest price ≠ greatest savings” if adoption fails; hence tools and workshops that quantify uptake risk and value-based tendering are prioritized.
- Differentiation emphasis: For Value payers and HCPs, channels that foreground totality of evidence, supply reliability, device/formulation, and services match CSF 3 and 4, and support CSF 5 (tender shaping) and CSF 6 (pull-through).
- Limitations: The source materials provide historical KPI timelines (2017–2018) and not current-year targets; we report them faithfully and treat them as templates. Market-by-country nuances in tender legality and substitution are acknowledged but not detailed here; channels should be localized accordingly.

Biggest SGLT2i initiation gaps by specialty and how to close them\n\n| Specialty | Biggest initiation gaps (what\u2019s not happening) | Likely drivers | Impacted KPIs | Priority actions |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Primary Care (PCP) | Under-screening UACR; incomplete CKD staging; therapeutic inertia to start SGLT2i in eligible CKD (esp. non-diabetic CKD); late nephrology referral; PA/cost barriers | Time constraints; CKD not top-of-mind; uncertainty on eligibility thresholds (eGFR \u226520, albuminuria); perceived side-effect concerns; PA burden | UACR testing rate; % CKD staged; SGLT2i initiation rate/time-to-start; referral-to-nephrology time; abandonment rate | Embed eGFR+UACR in annual labs for T2D/HTN; EMR best-practice alerts for SGLT2i eligibility; one-page start algorithm + \u201csick day\u201d counseling; ePA automation; define referral triggers (high UACR, rapid eGFR decline) |\n| Cardiology | SGLT2i starts limited to overt HF; CKD risk (albuminuria) not routinely assessed; hesitation to \u201cown\u201d CKD initiation if no HF; diuretic/volume concerns | CV event focus; albuminuria not routinely ordered; workflow lacks CKD prompts; role ambiguity with PCP/nephrology | Cardiology share of SGLT2i starts in CKD; % HF+CKD on SGLT2i; time-to-start post abnormal UACR; all-cause hospitalization | Add UACR to HF/ASCVD lab panels; co-authored cardiorenal pathway clarifying initiation responsibilities; initiation checklist (volume status, diuretic adjustment); ensure formulary/PA playbooks are available clinic-side |\n| Nephrology | Late referral limits eligible window (eGFR <20); variable adoption in non-albuminuric CKD; concern about advanced CKD starts and polypharmacy; competing priorities (anemia/bone/mineral, access planning) | Patients present late; uncertainty about benefit in low-albuminuric subsets; safety monitoring overhead | % stage 3\u20134 CKD on SGLT2i; time-to-start after nephro intake; % eligible-but-uninitiated; eGFR slope and UACR change | Partner upstream to pull-forward referrals (stage 3b, high UACR); standing order sets for SGLT2i assessment at intake; nurse-led start-and-monitor protocols; align with RAAS/finerenone sequencing where indicated |\n\nActionable next steps\n- Make eGFR+UACR universal in T2D/HTN annual panels and close the loop on abnormal UACR within 90 days.\n- Stand up a unified cardiorenal SGLT2i pathway (ownership, thresholds, labs, monitoring) adopted by PCP, cardiology, and nephrology.\n- Track SGLT2i initiation rate and time-to-initiation for eligible CKD patients by specialty; set quarterly improvement targets.\n- Reduce access friction: implement ePA, publish payer-specific PA guides, and monitor abandonment; target <15%.\n- Launch a short \u201cstart smart\u201d protocol: volume status check, diuretic adjustment if needed, sick-day rules, early follow-up at 2\u20134 weeks.\n- Create rapid referral triggers (e.g., UACR \u2265300 mg/g, rapid eGFR decline) and monitor referral timeliness.\n\nReasoning\n1) Parsed the request into two deliverables: a cross-specialty framework of CKD CSFs/SIs/KPIs and specialty-specific initiation gaps. 2) Identified core CKD processes that drive outcomes (screening, guideline-concordant therapy, access, monitoring, coordination) from the context (KDIGO-aligned staging, EMPA-KIDNEY outcomes, and quality frameworks listing eGFR/UACR testing, ACEi/ARB use, control of BP/A1c/LDL). 3) Selected SIs (leading process signals) and KPIs (quantifiable endpoints) that are measurable within typical EHR/claims datasets and used in CKD quality programs. 4) For initiation gaps, mapped barriers and remediation to each specialty\u2019s typical workflow and role: PCP (screening, staging, PA), cardiology (cardiorenal integration, albuminuria), nephrology (late referral, advanced CKD nuances). 5) Grounded benefits and targets in EMPA-KIDNEY (28% RRR progression/CV death; 14% hospitalization reduction) and CKD quality indicator literature (e.g., GFR/albuminuria testing KPIs, BP/A1c/LDL control gaps), noting that numeric targets are directional and should be calibrated to local baselines.\n\nRationale\n- Principles: Use of established quality frameworks (screening, ACEi/ARB optimization, risk-factor control), guideline-aligned therapy initiation (KDIGO), and high-impact outcome evidence (EMPA-KIDNEY) to define CSFs. SIs represent proximal process changes predicting improvement; KPIs are outcome/process measures suitable for dashboards and value-based care contracts. - Specialty tailoring: Initiation barriers differ by role\u2014PCPs face time/PA hurdles; cardiologists prioritize CV endpoints and need albuminuria integration; nephrologists face late referrals and advanced-stage complexity. - Limitations/uncertainty: Exact performance baselines (e.g., current SGLT2i penetration, BP/A1c/LDL goal attainment) vary by system; published percentages cited in the context are from specific studies/populations and should be considered directional. Targets provided are pragmatic stretch goals, not mandates; they should be customized to your local data and payer mix. - Assumptions: CKD program aims to expand SGLT2i use in eligible patients per label/guidelines; formulary access and ePA are achievable; cross-specialty governance can harmonize pathways.\n\nReferences\n- EMPA-KIDNEY trial summary (internal): JAR-INT-CED-FY25-V2.2, Section 14.3 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) \u2014 28% RRR in CKD progression/CV death; 14% RRR all-cause hospitalization.\n- Value/HEOR framing for CKD: JAR-INT-HEORVAL-FY25-V1.0 \u2014 Pillar 3: Slowing CKD progression and hospitalization cost offsets.\n- Patient journey/operational insights for CKD starts and monitoring: JAR-INT-PJOURNEY-HF_CKD-FY25-V1.0 \u2014 Adding protective therapy; monitoring; counseling workflows.\n- Guideline context (as referenced in internal materials): KDIGO recommendations to use SGLT2i broadly in CKD with eGFR \u226520 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2 and/or albuminuria (see KDIGO Diabetes in CKD and CKD guidelines).\n- CKD quality indicators (screening, BP/A1c/LDL targets, anemia/bone disease metrics): Context cites ISAHD CKD KPIs document and a CKD quality study (PMC11531362) demonstrating real-world gaps in BP, HbA1c, and LDL target attainment.\n- Underuse and adoption barriers for SGLT2i in CKD (cross-specialty): NEXT Insight Report excerpts and internal persona/channel strategy documents (JAR-INT-HCP-FY25-V2.0; JAR-INT-SBF-FY25-V2.1).

Targets provided are pragmatic stretch goals, not mandates; they should be customized to your local data and payer mix. - Assumptions: CKD program aims to expand SGLT2i use in eligible patients per label/guidelines; formulary access and ePA are achievable; cross-specialty governance can harmonize pathways.\n\nReferences\n- EMPA-KIDNEY trial summary (internal): JAR-INT-CED-FY25-V2.2, Section 14.3 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) — 28% RRR in CKD progression/CV death; 14% RRR all-cause hospitalization.\n- Value/HEOR framing for CKD: JAR-INT-HEORVAL-FY25-V1.0 — Pillar 3: Slowing CKD progression and hospitalization cost offsets.\n- Patient journey/operational insights for CKD starts and monitoring: JAR-INT-PJOURNEY-HF_CKD-FY25-V1.0 — Adding protective therapy; monitoring; counseling workflows.\n- Guideline context (as referenced in internal materials): KDIGO recommendations to use SGLT2i broadly in CKD with eGFR ≥20 mL/min/1.73 m² and/or albuminuria (see KDIGO Diabetes in CKD and CKD guidelines).\n- CKD quality indicators (screening, BP/A1c/LDL targets, anemia/bone disease metrics): Context cites ISAHD CKD KPIs document and a CKD quality study (PMC11531362) demonstrating real-world gaps in BP, HbA1c, and LDL target attainment.\n- Underuse and adoption barriers for SGLT2i in CKD (cross-specialty): NEXT Insight Report excerpts and internal persona/channel strategy documents (JAR-INT-HCP-FY25-V2.0; JAR-INT-SBF-FY25-V2.1).",

The user also provided extensive contextual data about Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patient journey maps, clinical evidence, and various strategic documents related to Jardiance (empagliflozin).\n\nLet me break down what the user is asking for:\n1. CSFs = Critical Success Factors\n2. SIs = Success Indicators\n3. KPIs = Key Performance Indicators\n4. They want these specifically for CKD\n5. They want to understand initiation gaps by specialty (cardiology, nephrology, PCP)\n6. They want this presented in tabular form\n\nLooking at the search results, I can see several relevant KPIs and indicators for CKD care:\n\nFrom search result [1] (Innovaccer):\n- Clinical quality indicators should include rates of CKD progression, blood pressure control, glycemic management for diabetic patients, and appropriate medication utilization\n- Utilization metrics track reductions in preventable hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and transitions to dialysis\n- Patient-reported outcomes measure improvements in quality of life, symptom burden, and satisfaction with care\n- Financial performance indicators demonstrate cost savings through reduced complications\n\nFrom search result [2] (PMC study):\n- Shows actual performance data on various quality indicators like BP control, HbA1c control, LDL-C control, etc.\n\nFrom search result [3] (ISAHD PDF):\n- Lists 7 specific KPIs for CKD including GFR/albuminuria testing, glycemic control, anemia/bone disease assessment, etc.\n\nFrom search result [4]:\n- Mentions KPIs for dialysis centers and hemodialysis quality assessment\n\nFrom the contextual data, I can see information about patient journey maps, gaps in care, and opportunities for intervention at different stages.",

Competitive Landscape Overview:\n\nThe FY2025 cardiorenal market remains hyper-competitive. Jardiance faces intense pressure from its primary SGLT2i rival (Farxiga) which mirrors its key indications, and disruptive competition from the GLP-1 RA class, led by highly effective agents (semaglutide, tirzepatide) leveraging potent A1c/weight loss and expanding into CV/renal research. Maintaining leadership requires proactive intelligence gathering, clear differentiation based on unique data points (esp. EMPA-REG CV death), and agile response strategies grounded in approved LMR materials.\n\n**Estimated competitor promotional spend (US):** Farxiga  \n**400M\\*\\*, Ozempic/Rybelsus/Wegovy franchise >> 400M\\*\\*, Ozempic/Rybelsus/Wegovy franchise >> \\*\\*\\***\n\n### 1B.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

What are their key motivators, pain points, unmet needs relevant to this communication? What is their current perception of Jardiance for this indication?\n\n- **Secondary Audience(s):** (If applicable - e.g., Office Staff for access materials).\n\n- **Example:** Primary: Persona B PCPs. Insights: Time-poor, overwhelmed by CKD guidelines, need simple rationale for adding new med, concerned about PA hurdles/cost. Current Belief: May see Jardiance primarily as T2D/HF drug, unaware of broad CKD benefit, esp. in non-T2D.\n\n---\n\n- **E. Communication Proposition / The Single Most Important Thing (SMIT):**\n\n  - *What is the single, most compelling message we want the audience to take away?*\n\n  - *Should be concise, benefit-oriented, and differentiated (where possible).*\n\n  - **Example:** Jardiance is proven to significantly slow CKD progression and reduce hospitalizations in a broad range of adult CKD patients at risk, offering vital protection beyond BP/glucose control.\n\n---\n\n- **F. Key Supporting Points & Evidence:**\n\n  - *What are the main reasons to believe the proposition?* List key data points, clinical evidence, or rationales.\n\n  - MUST reference specific data from approved PI/Clinical Dossier (Ref: Doc 2).\n\n  - **Example:**\n    1. EMPA-KIDNEY showed 28% RRR in CKD progression/CV death (HR 0.72).\n    2. Reduced all-cause hospitalizations by 14% (HR 0.86).\n    3. Benefit shown in patients WITH and WITHOUT T2D.\n    4. Indicated down to eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73 m².\n    5. Once-daily oral dosing.\n\n---\n\n- **G. Desired Audience Response / Call to Action:**\n\n  - *What do we want the audience to THINK, FEEL, and DO after seeing this communication?*\n\n  - Make the \"DO\" specific and actionable.\n\n  - **Example:** THINK: \"Jardiance offers meaningful kidney protection I should consider for my CKD patients.\" FEEL: \"Confident I can help slow progression.\" DO: \"Identify CKD patients meeting criteria (eGFR/UACR) and consider initiating Jardiance 10mg / Visit JardianceHCP.com/CKD for resources.\"\n\n---\n\n- **H. Tone of Voice:**\n\n  - *Describe the desired personality and feeling of the communication.*\n\n  - Reference Brand Voice Guide (Ref: Doc 10) and tailor if needed.\n\n  - **Example:** Confident, Clear, Urgent (Time to Act), Supportive, Scientific yet Accessible (for PCP audience).",

Reducing total HHF events directly translates to significant potential cost savings for the health plan / system. Position Jardiance as an investment to reduce downstream acute care costs.\n- Supporting HEOR Concepts: BIMs focused on HF populations. CEAs vs. standard care components without SGLT2i. Real-World Evidence (RWE) studies (e.g., EMPRISE) demonstrating similar hospitalization reductions in routine practice.\n\n**Pillar 3: Slowing Chronic Kidney Disease Progression & Associated Costs:**\n  - Clinical Anchor: EMPA-KIDNEY showed **28% RRR in CKD progression or CV death**, plus **14% RRR in all-cause hospitalization**.\n  - Economic Angle: Slowing progression delays or avoids extremely high costs associated with End-Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD) requiring dialysis (>$80k/patient/year) or transplantation. Reducing all-cause hospitalizations in this high-risk population also provides significant cost offsets.\n  - Supporting HEOR Concepts: BIMs modeling impact on CKD progression rates and dialysis costs. CEAs demonstrating long-term cost-effectiveness in delaying ESKD. Hospitalization cost-offset analyses based on EMPA-KIDNEY data.\n\n### 4. Key Data Inputs for Models/Dossiers:\n\n- Efficacy data (HRs, ARRs) from EMPA-REG, EMPEROR, EMPA-KIDNEY.\n- Safety/tolerability data from clinical trials.\n- Hospitalization rates and costs (literature-based, claims data).\n- Dialysis costs (USRDS data).\n- Drug acquisition costs (WAC, expected Net Price).\n- Quality of Life data (e.g., KCCQ scores from EMPEROR, utility values from literature) for QALY calculations.\n- RWE data supporting trial findings in real-world populations.\n\n### 5. Communication Guidance:\n\n- Value story must be presented using AMCP format dossier or other payer-appropriate, evidence-based formats.\n- All models and analyses must use transparent, validated methodologies and assumptions.\n- Communications tailored to specific payer/HTA body priorities (e.g., budget impact focus vs. long-term cost-effectiveness).\n- Must be delivered by trained Market Access / HEOR personnel.\n```\n(No tables, equations, or images were present on the page.

Purpose:\nThis document summarizes the core Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR) value arguments for Jardiance, intended primarily for internal strategic alignment and to inform communications with US Payers, HTA bodies, and Formulary Committees. This information **is distinct from promotional messaging used with HCPs** and requires adaptation and appropriate evidence dossiers (e.g., AMCP Format Dossier) for external payer engagement by Market Access teams.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Target Audience for Value Story:\nUS Payers (Commercial PBMs, Medicare Part D Plans, Medicaid Directors), Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs), Hospital Formulary Committees (P&T), Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies (where applicable globally).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Core Value Proposition Pillars:\nJardiance delivers significant clinical value across T2D, HF, and CKD by reducing major morbidity and mortality events, which translates into potential economic value for healthcare systems through cost offsets.\n\n- **Pillar 1: Reducing Costly Cardiovascular Events (T2D + Established CVD):**\n    - **Clinical Anchor:** EMPA-REG OUTCOME demonstrated **38% RRR in CV Death and 35% RRR in HHF**.\n    - **Economic Angle:** Reduction in CV death avoids substantial end-of-life costs. Reduction in HF hospitalizations avoids high-cost acute care episodes (avg. HF hospitalization cost ~ 15k–20k). Frame as potential cost offset or budget impact neutral/favorable over medium term for high-risk T2D populations.\n    - **Supporting HEOR Concepts:** Budget Impact Models (BIMs) projecting plan costs with/without increased Jardiance utilization. Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) vs older therapies (e.g., SU, DPP4i) often showing favorable ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio) below accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds (e.g., <$100k/QALY gained) based on published models.\n\n- **Pillar 2: Reducing the Burden of Heart Failure Hospitalizations (Across EF Spectrum):**\n\n---\n```",

FY2024 performance demonstrated robust growth, particularly driven by HF and the initial CKD launch uptake, exceeding global revenue targets by **3.1%**. However, significant competitive pressure from AstraZeneca's Farxiga and the encroaching GLP-1 RA class (notably Novo Nordisk's semaglutide franchise) necessitates continued strategic focus on differentiation, market access optimization, and flawless execution in FY2025. This dossier serves as the foundational internal reference for strategic planning, marketing execution, and cross-functional alignment for FY2025. Estimated US lifecycle extends to approximately **2031** based on current patent portfolio (subject to ongoing legal review and potential pediatric extensions).\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Consistent benefit observed on top of standard of care (high statin/RASi use).\n\n#### • Heart Failure (HFrEF & HFpEF):\n  - **Primary Message Anchor**: \"Reduces the risk of **CV death or HF hospitalization** across the spectrum of HF, from HFrEF (25% RRR, NNT=19/16mo) to HFpEF (21% RRR, NNT=31/26mo), regardless of diabetes status (EMPEROR Program).\"\n  - **Supporting Points**: Significantly reduces **total (first + recurrent) HF hospitalizations** (~30% HFrEF, ~27% HFpEF). Slows progression of kidney disease in HF patients. May offer modest QoL improvements (KCCQ data). Foundational therapy recommended by guidelines.\n\n#### • Chronic Kidney Disease:\n  - **Primary Message Anchor**: \"Slows CKD progression and reduces CV death risk by **28% RRR** in a broad range of adults with CKD at risk (EMPA-KIDNEY), NNT=26 over 2 yrs.\"\n```\n*[All data and definitions are maintained as per original layout.

Introduction:\nThis document serves as a primary source of truth defining the operational environment and mandatory compliance rules for promoting Jardiance® (empagliflozin) in key global markets for FY2025. It details market dynamics, payer landscapes, regulatory oversight, and provides explicit operational guardrails (Do's and Don'ts) based on applicable laws, regulations, codes, and internal policies. All promotional concepts, strategies, and materials generated, regardless of method (human or AI-assisted), MUST strictly adhere to these market-specific constraints. Adherence is mandatory; non-compliance carries severe consequences.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Primary Market Focus: United States (US)\n\n#### • Market Overview:\n  - **Size/Scope:** Largest global market (~68% revenue). High prevalence: T2D (~35M), HF (~6.5M), CKD (~37M). Key growth opportunity in HFpEF and diagnosed-but-undertreated CKD (<15% SGLT2i penetration).\n  - **Dynamics:** Intense SGLT2i vs SGLT2i (Farxiga) and SGLT2i vs GLP-1 RA (Semaglutide/Tirzepatide) competition. Guideline adherence (ADA/ACC/AHA/KDIGO) is critical. High promotional environment requires differentiated, compliant messaging.\n\n#### • Payer/Access Environment:\n  - **Structure:** Fragmented: Commercial PBMs (ESI, Caremark, OptumRx), Medicare Part D, Medicaid. Access is highly managed.\n  - **Key Constraints:** \n    - Tier 2/3 placement standard (~85% Commercial lives Tier 3+).\n    - Prior Authorizations (PAs) & Step Therapies (STs - typically metformin first) are common operational hurdles.\n    - IRA Price Negotiation impacts Medicare strategy (MFP effective 2026).\n    - Net price realization averages ~47% of WAC. Patient OOP costs are a barrier; access support programs (co-pay cards, PAPs) are operationally essential.\n\n#### • Regulatory Body & Oversight:\n  - **Primary Body:** FDA/CDER.\n  - **Promotional Oversight:** OPDP (enforces FD&C Act, 21 CFR Part 202).\n  - **Other Oversight:** OIG (Anti-Kickback Statute), DOJ (False Claims Act), CMS (Medicare/Medicaid rules).\n\n---\n\n[FIG]\nIn the upper right corner, the Jardiance® logo appears featuring the brand name with \"empagliflozin\" below it.

This is a very comprehensive query asking about \"top CKD CSFs/SIs/KPIs and biggest initiation gaps by cardiology, nephrology, and PCP\" and requesting the answer in tabular form. The user also provided extensive contextual data about Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patient journey maps, clinical evidence, and various strategic documents related to Jardiance (empagliflozin).\n\nLet me break down what the user is asking for:\n1. CSFs = Critical Success Factors\n2. SIs = Success Indicators  \n3. KPIs = Key Performance Indicators\n4. They want these specifically for CKD\n5. They want to understand initiation gaps by specialty (cardiology, nephrology, PCP)\n6. They want this presented in tabular form\n\nLooking at the search results, I can see several relevant KPIs and indicators for CKD care:\n\nFrom search result [1] (Innovaccer):\n- Clinical quality indicators should include rates of CKD progression, blood pressure control, glycemic management for diabetic patients, and appropriate medication utilization\n- Utilization metrics track reductions in preventable hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and transitions to dialysis\n- Patient-reported outcomes measure improvements in quality of life, symptom burden, and satisfaction with care\n- Financial performance indicators demonstrate cost savings through reduced complications\n\nFrom search result [2] (PMC study):\n- Shows actual performance data on various quality indicators like BP control, HbA1c control, LDL-C control, etc.\n\nFrom search result [3] (ISAHD PDF):\n- Lists 7 specific KPIs for CKD including GFR/albuminuria testing, glycemic control, anemia/bone disease assessment, etc.\n\nFrom search result [4]:\n- Mentions KPIs for dialysis centers and hemodialysis quality assessment\n\nFrom the contextual data, I can see information about patient journey maps, gaps in care, and opportunities for intervention at different stages.\n\nLet me organize this into a comprehensive table showing the top CKD CSFs/SIs/KPIs and the biggest initiation gaps by specialty.\n\n\nBased on the provided search results and contextual data, I'll present the top CKD Critical Success Factors (CSFs), Success Indicators (SIs), and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), along with the biggest initiation gaps by specialty.\n\n## **Top CKD CSFs/SIs/KPIs and Initiation Gaps by Specialty**\n\n### **Core CKD Performance Indicators**\n\n| **Category** | **Key Performance Indicator** | **Target/Benchmark** | **Current Performance Gap** |\n|--------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Clinical Quality** | CKD progression rate (eGFR decline) | <3 mL/min/1.73m²/year | 28% of patients show rapid progression[1] |\n| **Screening & Monitoring** | Annual GFR and albuminuria testing | 100% of CKD patients | Significant gaps in routine monitoring[3] |\n| **Blood Pressure Control** | BP <140/90 mmHg in hypertensive CKD patients | >80% | 62.3% achieving target[2] |\n| **Glycemic Management** | HbA1c <7.5% in diabetic CKD patients | >70% | 52.1% achieving target[2] |\n| **Lipid Management** | LDL-C <100 mg/dL | >60% | 41.7% achieving target[2] |\n| **Anemia Management** | Hemoglobin monitoring and treatment | >90% appropriate management | 94.5% with Hb <10 g/dL managed[2] |\n| **Bone Disease Prevention** | Phosphorus <4.5 mg/dL | >75% | 75.6% achieving target[2] |\n\n### **Specialty-Specific Initiation Gaps**\n\n| **Specialty** | **Primary Gaps** | **Impact on Patient Care** | **Recommended Actions** |\n|---------------|------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Primary Care Physicians (PCPs)** | -

I analyzed clinical quality indicators from recent studies, regulatory guidelines, and real-world performance data to construct a comprehensive view of where healthcare systems are falling short in CKD management.\n\n## **Rationale**\n\nThe table structure prioritizes actionable metrics that directly impact patient outcomes and healthcare costs. I focused on measurable indicators with established benchmarks, emphasizing the significant gaps between current performance and optimal care standards. The specialty-specific analysis reflects the different roles and challenges each provider type faces in CKD management, with particular attention to the underutilization of evidence-based therapies like SGLT2 inhibitors.\n\n## **References**\n\n[1] Innovaccer Value-Based CKD Care Analysis - Clinical quality indicators and utilization metrics\n[2] PMC Study (PMC11531362) - Quality indicators of secondary health care in chronic kidney disease with specific performance data\n[3] ISAHD CKD KPIs and Recommendations - Seven key performance indicators for chronic kidney disease management\n[4] AMMS Publication - Role of KPIs in clinical self-assessment for hemodialysis quality
